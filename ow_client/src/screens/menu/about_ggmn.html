<p>GGMN (Global Groundwater Monitoring Network) is a participative, web-based network of networks, set up to improve
quality and accessibility of groundwater monitoring information and subsequently our knowledge on the state of
groundwater resources. GGMN is a UNESCO programme, implemented by IGRAC (International Groundwater Resources Assessment
Centre) and supported by many global and regional partners.</p>

<strong>GGMN Portal</strong>
<p>The GGMN portal (<a href='https://ggmn.un-igrac.org/'>https://ggmn.un-igrac.org/</a>) assists in the spatial and temporal analysis of monitoring data and can be
configured for your own organisation and projects. Data can be set to be private (only accessible for authorised users)
or public.</p>

<strong>Join the network!</strong>
<p>If you would like to be part of the GGMN programme and make use of the GGMN portal together with the app, please
contact us to <a href='mailto:info@un-igrac.org'>info@un-igrac.org</a> for more information or visit our <a href='https://www.un-igrac.org/ggmn'>website</a>. If not, feel free to use the app to store
groundwater level monitoring data in your phone.‚Äù</p>
